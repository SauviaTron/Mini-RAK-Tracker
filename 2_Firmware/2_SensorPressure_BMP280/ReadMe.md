# BMP280

Programming this component is fairly straightforward since all the necessary functions are included in the Adafruit library. In addition to the provided functions, I've incorporated my own custom functions for configuring, monitoring, and putting the sensor to sleep. This approach not only streamlines the code but also enhances readability.
